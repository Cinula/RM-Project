 *  Chat with registered users, for communication and get to know each other 
 * Find people who support this same club like visiting users
 * Shop for souvenirs or gifts, like Real Madrid t-shirts and jerseys
 * Calendar with Real Madrid game schedule
live updates on matches
 * Could Create another website like this for other football clubs  
 * Unlimited potential for many more features in the future.  

# Typography and color scheme 

I use the colors white and blue like the Logo of Real Madrid Clube to be connected with the website, which I believe is nice visible, and readable. 
I use the font-family Verdana to style the text, for easy reading and visibility.

# Bugs and errors 

* Had too many H1 elements in my projects, there should be only 1 H1 element as a title. 
    * I did change all H1 elements to H2 elements except Title.
I have an error with the section element, Had a section element without the title, to swap all section elements to a divs element. Divs do not need to have a title. A lot of HTML & CSS:

    * typing mistakes 
    * semi-colon missing 
    * colon missing 
    * brackets missing

        * to fix it I had to review the code find all the missing attributes and place it in the right order.  

* picture size and quality, some of the images were poor quality too big or too small. 
    * To fix it had to use a tool to resize to images to fit the style. 

*  The website content was too crowded
Remove some unnecessary content like numbers on the list for better style and visibility.
